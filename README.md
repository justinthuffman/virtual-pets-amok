#Virtual Pets Amok

##Learned my lesson last project: starting from scratch.

###Just like shelter, organic pets need food, water, and to go to the bathroom. This time robotic pets have been added and instead of feeding need oil/maintenance.

Dogs have cages. Cats have a litter box. These all need cleaned. Walking dogs reduces waste.

If hunger, thirst, waste, happiness, or maintenance go above 10, health decreases.

Each action has a tick that affects all variables.
